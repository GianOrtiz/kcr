# kcr

KCR (Kubernetes Checkpoint Restore) is a Kubernetes Operator to automate the checkpoint and restore of stateful deployments. It allows users to define schedules to checkpoint stateful applications and later restore them when they fail.

## Description

Stateful applications depend on its memory content to provide its service. When a stateful application crashes the state is lost. Stateful application running on Kubernetes upon a fail and a restart cannot provide high availability due to the missing state upon a restart. Checkpoint is a techinique to "save" the state of the application so we can later use it to restore the application to the last saved state, checkpointing the application the application in time. The checkpoint can be used for later investigation of problems or to provide better availability for applications by having a hot copy when we need to restart the application. It can also be used in node migration to allow the application to be migrated without losing its state.

KCR provides a way to save scheduled checkpoints of stateful applicatons and later use them to recover the application. It provides the functionality to checkpoint the stateful application and when the application fail restore it automatically. But we will provide a way to schedule checkpoints and restore over demand, so we can use them for other puporses like migrating nodes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- go version v1.23.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.30.0+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.30.0+ cluster with CRIU and btrfs.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kcr:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kcr:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/kcr:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/kcr/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.

## Contributing

If you have anything to contribute to the project feel free to open an issue or merge request. I will not provide a good support to this project as I made it for fun. There is a development guide [here](/docs/development.md).

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
